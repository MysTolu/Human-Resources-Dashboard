In this project, I analyzed a human resource dataset and presented my findings using Excel to build an interactive dashboard.
Data Acquisition: The “Human Resources” excel file was gotten from the Real World, Fake Data website. The data has 13 fields and 22,214 records that provides information about the employees such as names, birthdate, jobtitle, department, hire date and location. However, one of the fields was deleted due to incomplete information.
Data verification: This was done to ensure that information contained in each column is of the correct format and datatype. 
Furthermore, using the formula: =INT(YEARFRAC(CELLNAME, TODAY())), two other columns were added to the dataset; ‘Age’ and ‘Years of Hire’ calculated from the ‘birthdate’ and ‘hire_date’ columns respectively.
The elements of my dashboard include;
Key performance indicators (KPI): 3 KPIs were used to measure employment in the dataset being considered, these are the total number of the employees, the average age of the employees and the distribution of the employees in their work location (HQ and remotely). 
Slicers: In order to filter our data, 5 slicers namely employee gender, year of hire, state location, city location, and job title were added.
Line chart: Used to show how employees were hired over the years (hiring rate by year)
Doughnut chart: Depicts the gender ratio of all the employees in total (Gender of employees)
Bar chart: There are 3 bar charts showing the distribution of employees by their work department, ethnic race as well as state location.
